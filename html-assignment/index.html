                <p> My name is bilcrist Abraham i am from the southern part of india i came to canada as an international student on 6<sup>th</sup> semptember 2022.
                    i started my course in the computer programming. but later i changed my course to <abbr title="interactive media design
                ">IMD</abbr><strong>algonquin college</strong>  offers a variety of options to find our co-op education as well.
                <p2>from the childhood itself i have been into designing and coding which really boosted my intrest in this particular program.After my graduation from this course i would love to start a buisness in this fdield so as to acquire financial freedom which could consequently enhance my lifestyle.
                    eventhough the course is hard ,still i  love the modules of the program.finally this program mainly focuses on the skilled works and the essential element which an artistic technician should have.as far as this is my second program i am sure that i would work as ahardv as posssible to gain the very good grades in this program. </p2>
